## **Practice V**

### **Description**

In this assignment, you will create an Android application of your choice. However, the application should incorporate at least 2 out of the 5 Material design elements: Toolbar, Floating Button, Navigation Drawer, RecyclerView / CardView, and Bottom Navigation View. Moreover, the application should include a basic implementation of the Google Maps Fragment, where it will show a specific location in the maps. You may use Latitude/Longitude coordinates. Please, use your creativity to design the app and follow the material design guidelines. Next, you may find a few suggestions on how to design the application so that it meets the criteria defined in the assignment's rubric.

#### Suggestion

1.  Implement a Toolbar at the top of your app. Customize it with your desired title and navigation icon.
2.  Add a Floating Button to your app, and customize it with your desired icon and color.
3.  Implement a Navigation Drawer, and customize it with your desired items and icons.
4.  Add a RecyclerView/CardView to your app, and customize it with your desired layout and items.
5.  Implement a Bottom Navigation View, and customize it with your desired items and icons.
6.  Add the Google Maps Fragment to your app, and display a specific location based on coordinates.
7.  Add functionality to the UI elements (e.g., Floating Button, Navigation Drawer, and Bottom Navigation View) so that the user can interact with the app and perform specific actions.
8.  Test the application and make sure that all elements of Material Design are functioning correctly.

#### Deliverables

*   The source code for the Android app.
*   A brief write-up explaining the key design decisions and challenges faced during the development process. It should also include a section where you describe the idea of the application and the functionalities that you implemented.
*   A video demonstrating the app's functionality.

Please, submit a single **PDF file** containing all the required information. For the source code portion, you should provide a link to the project GitHub and invite the instructor to collaborate.
